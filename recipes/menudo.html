    <h2>Description: Filipino Menudo (Pork and Liver Stew) - This rich pork dish is usually prepared on special occasions or when expecting company.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ¼ boneless pork chops</li>
      <li>½ pound pork liver</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained</li>
      <li>1 (1.5 ounce) box raisins</li>
      <li>2 potatoes, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add the pork chops and return to a boil. Cook the pork chops at a boil for 5 minutes, remove, and set aside to cool. Remove 1 cup of the broth from the pot and set aside for later use. Once the chops are cooled to the touch, cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
      <li>Return the water to a boil; add the pork liver to the pot and cook at a boil until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard the liquid. Set the liver aside to cool; cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the pork chops into the onion and garlic; cook and stir together for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes and reserved broth; cover and cook for 10 minutes. Stir the pork liver, garbanzo beans, raisins, and potatoes into the mixture; cover and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
